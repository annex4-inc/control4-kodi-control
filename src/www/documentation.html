<h2>Workarounds</h2>
<p>
    This driver manages a Websocket and HTTP connection to your Kodi device as there is a known issue in Kodi that causes a connection to block when a dialog window opens.
    When the issue occurs, the driver will detect the blocked connection and finish the dialog window interaction with the other connection. In terms of functionality you won't notice anything
